//Based on the description I think this is just supposed to show what's already in the db. not adding new ingredients (?)


//If there needs to be an add then do the same thing as before with the api for meal planner, modal, api.

//Get the ingredients from the db
//Check boxes 
//delete buttons

//Have it just like a shopping list centered on the page. Have each update stored in the db (e.g. checked off == yes)
