//Loading everything
//I need the current meal plan for the user from the database
//Once I have it (the url to the api and the day it's on should be enough):
//for each item on the meal plan list, fetch info from the url and add it to the correct day


//adding a new one:
//The person clicks a button next to the day and it brings up a modal that shows a list of cards from the api
//user clicks on it and it works
//Make request to add it to database, reload the page and it will be loaded in from above

//ALTERNATIVELY just leave it on the recipe details page. For the sake of simplicity leave it to that for now


//removing one:
//delete button right next to it.
//Make request to delete from database
